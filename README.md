ketama4j
========

An implementation of the Ketama consistent hashing algorithm for "nodes" of Strings.

This project builds on work done by Dustin Sallings (et al) in the [Spy Memcached](https://github.com/dustin/java-memcached-client) project.

(This project hasn't yet been checked for interoperability with any other libraries.)
